Adding just a couple of lines here   
just for testing.  

and even more lines.  
and even more and more and more.   
how about some more.  
and more

Here is a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

Then we have more text here and some more here and here

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

What if there is some text in between?

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.
	Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.
	`{ my code }`
	Add as many paragraphs as you like.
